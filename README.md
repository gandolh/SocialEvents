# SocialEvents
Social Events is a web application developed using Next.js and Express. The purpose of the application is to
streamline the event management process within a company. Users can be grouped into departments, and when
creating an event, the host can invite an entire department or individual persons. The visual appearance was the
focal point of this project, creating an interface with Tailwind that adheres to the UI rules of Mica UI (the theme
used by Windows) and Material UI.
